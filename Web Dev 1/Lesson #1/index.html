    Birria tacos, if you haven't heard of them yet all over
    social media and the internet, is traditionally an 
    addictive sweet, sour, slightly spicy, and utterly 
    savory Mexican beef or goat stew that's slow cooked 
    until the meat is tender and fall-apart juicy and 
    delicious. Someone had the bright idea to stuff this 
    beefy goodness into a taco shell, and then dip the 
    whole mess into the stew and fry it up. They blew 
    up after that, and the rest is history. But unlike 
    most fad foods, Birria tacos are so good you'll be 
    making them every week.
